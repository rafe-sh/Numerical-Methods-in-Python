# Numerical-Methods-in-Python
Welcome to the Numerical Methods in Python repository! 🚀 This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various numerical methods implemented in Python. These notebooks were created as part of a course on numerical methods. 🔢💻

## What's Inside? 🤔
This repository contains the following notebooks:

- `Root-Finding Methods.ipynb`: 💡 Learn about various root-finding methods, including bisection, Newton-Raphson, and secant methods. Get ready to be blown away by the power of these methods! 💥💥💥

- `Interpolation and Curve Fitting.ipynb`: 📈 Discover the magic of polynomial interpolation and curve fitting using least squares. You'll be amazed at how easy it is to fit curves to your data! 🤯

- `Numerical Differentiation.ipynb`: 🎲 Take your math skills to the next level and learn about numerical differentiation using finite differences. You'll never look at derivatives the same way again! 🤓

## Requirements
To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed, as well as the following packages:
```
NumPy 🧮
Matplotlib 📊
SciPy 🧪
```
These packages can be installed using pip or another package manager. 📦
